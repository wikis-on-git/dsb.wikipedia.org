<!--The majority of Wendish immigrants to the [[United States]] settled in Texas, using Serbin as the "mother colony". It was during [[1854]] that about 550 Wendish [[Lutherans]] from congregations in [[Prussia]] and [[Saxony]] left for Texas under the leadership of [[John Kilian]]. Upon arriving in Texas, the people of Serbin became some of the earliest members of the [[Missouri]] [[Synod]] of the Lutheran church. [[St. Paul's Lutheran Church]], stands as a typical example of Wendish architecture; the pulpit is located in the balcony of the church.

Originally called '''Low Pin Oak Settlement''', the community's name was changed to ''Serbin'' meaning ''Wendish land'', before [[1860]].

The [[Texas Wendish Heritage Museum]] is housed in a former parochial school in Serbin.-->
